# X-Files - MiniTV
A take on the viral Simpsons Mini TV - An X-Files 1990s style TV.

This variant of the popular Simpsons TV featured in Make: Magazine, and online all over the place.
Here's the real build guide... https://withrow.io/simpsons-tv-build-guide

I created this 1990s-style TV/VCR combo TV for an X-Mas present. (X-mas, X-files)

I used this screen instead of the one called out in Brandon's guide. His was discontinued...

This meant that I couldnt use the version of Raspbarian that he did, which also meant that I couldn't use OMX Player as it's been EOLed. I used CVLC instead, which you'll see in the code. Otherwise, it's largely the same.

I also used Handbrake to compress my digital media. I thought this was easier to queue things up.

The 3D files here could use some work as I did't really finish everything I wanted to before the holiday. The files work within reason, but I have not implemented volume or on/off functions yet. Soon enough.

I printed with a Elegoo Mars 2. Just fits on the buildplate (whew). And printed the back FDM with an Ender 3 Pro.
